Modelling Future Wholesale Prices in Great Britainâ€™s Energy Market

This Python code utilizes the PyPSA-GB model to simulate the future Great Britain's wholesale energy market. It was developed as part of a Master's dissertation for the MSc in Sustainable Energy Systems program at The University of Edinburgh.

PyPSA-GB Github can be accessed via this link https://github.com/andrewlyden/PyPSA-GB, and PyPSA-GB notebook can be accessed via https://pypsa-gb.readthedocs.io/ .

The data for Market Index Prices was retrieved from Elexon (https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/market-index-prices). Since the available download period is restricted to one week, a code was implemented to collect data for an entire month. This approach was used in the dissertation to analyze the energy market over a full year.
